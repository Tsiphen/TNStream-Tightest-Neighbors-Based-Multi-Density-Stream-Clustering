In the field of clustering, a systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Current data stream clustering methods still face significant challenges and no existing algorithm can simultaneously handle large-scale, arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, and high-dimensional data while maintaining strong resistance to outliers. Clustering quality often deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a fully online stream clustering algorithm based on TN (TNStream). The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in Micro-Clusters (MCs). It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) data structures are employed to organize MCs, addressing the challenge of storing $k$-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.
%This study proposes a data stream clustering algorithm, TNStream, based on the Tightest Neighbors (TN) relationship. By constructing the Tightest Neighbors Graph (TNG), we investigate the relationship between the number of tightest neighbors and graph connectivity. Through the relationship between Tightest Neighborhood Closure Invariance and the multiplicity \( k \), we define the Tightest Neighborhood Closure Invariant Set and propose the \( k \)-TNC clustering algorithm by setting an appropriate \( k \). Theoretically, we introduce the Absolutely Distance Dividable (ADD) dataset and further propose the Connectedly Dividable (CD) dataset for cases with weaker conditions. By analyzing the fundamental principles of data stream clustering, we define Prototype Points as representatives of clusters and introduce the Skeleton Set as a structural determinant of data stream clustering. Utilizing KD-Tree, Ball-Tree, and LSH, we construct the Skeleton Set from Micro-Clusters and apply the \( k \)-TNC algorithm to form Macro-Clusters from the data stream. Experimental results demonstrate that TNStream effectively clusters arbitrarily shaped data, exhibits robustness to outliers, efficiently handles high-dimensional data, and achieves high-quality clustering within an acceptable runtime. Furthermore, it excels in clustering multi-density data, consistently outperforming traditional clustering algorithms in clustering quality. These findings further confirm the practical applicability and effectiveness of TNStream in dynamic data stream clustering analysis, marking a significant advancement in this field.
