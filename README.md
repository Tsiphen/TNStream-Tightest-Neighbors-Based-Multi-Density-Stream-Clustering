In the field of clustering, a systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Current data stream clustering methods still face significant challenges and no existing algorithm can simultaneously handle large-scale, arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, and high-dimensional data while maintaining strong resistance to outliers. Clustering quality often deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a fully online stream clustering algorithm based on TN (TNStream). The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in Micro-Clusters (MCs). It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) data structures are employed to organize MCs, addressing the challenge of storing $k$-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.
